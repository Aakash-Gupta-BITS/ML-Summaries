## Overview of Topics to Cover

1. Chapter 1 – Preliminaries

   1. Introduction
   2. Unit Vectors and Elementary Matrices
      - Proofs at the end of this section can be understood/derived via Bra-Ket notation but they are not required for ML afaik
   3. Decomposition of matrix
      - Proof is required I guess. You need to go through them and in case of any doubts, let me know
   4. Trace Equation
      - Need to remember $tr(AB)=tr(BA)$ and how to derive it (Derivations set the base to understand the more complicated results of differentiation)
   5. Vec operator
      - Only definition. Can skip the examples and derivations

2. Chapter 2 – The Kronecker Product

   1. Introduction

   2. Definition of Kronecker Product

   3. Some properties and rules for Kronecker Products

      - No need to see the proofs, just remember the results or write them down

      - Important result: $vec(A\times Y\times B)=(B^T\times A)\times vec(Y)$

      - See example 2.2

      - See example 2.3, part i and ii

   4. Can skip remaining chapter

3. Chapter 4 – Introduction to Matrix Calculus

   1. Introduction

   2. The derivatives of vectors

      - Can skip example 4.2

      - Need to derive 4 equations of table 4.4

   3. Chain Rule for vectors

      - Just remember equation 4.6, that the chain rule is reversed here

   4. The derivative of scalar functions of a matrix with respect to the matrix

      - Just the definition 4.7 and Example 4.3
